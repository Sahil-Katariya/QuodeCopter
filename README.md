# 🚀 Autonomous Drone Navigation System (ISRO Robotics Challenge 2025)

## 📌 Project Overview

Developed as part of the **ISRO Robotics Challenge – URSC 2025**, this project presents a **GPS-independent, vision-based navigation system** for autonomous drone traversal in Martian-like environments.  
The system leverages **computer vision, machine learning, and sensor fusion** to achieve real-time navigation, obstacle avoidance, and path planning without relying on GPS signals.
